# What is RudderStack?

[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data pipeline** tool for collecting, routing and processing data from your websites, apps, cloud tools, and data warehouse.

More information on RudderStack can be found [here](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server).

## Integrating AppsFlyer with RudderStack's iOS SDK

1. Add [Appsflyer](https://www.appsflyer.com) as a destination in the [Dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and provide ```devKey``` and `appleAppId` from your iTunes profile.

2. Rudder-Appsflyer is available through [**CocoaPods**](https://cocoapods.org) and [**Swift Package Manager (SPM)**](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).
### CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'Rudder-Appsflyer'
```
### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You can also add the RudderStack iOS SDK via Swift Package Mangaer, via one of the following two ways:

* [Xcode](#xcode)
* [Swift](#swift)

#### Xcode

* Go to **File** - **Add Package**, as shown:

* Enter the package repository (`git@github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-appsflyer-ios.git`) in the search bar.

* In **Dependency Rule**, select **Up to Next Major Version** and enter `2.4.0` as the value, as shown:

![Setting dependency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/145574696-8c849749-13e0-40d5-aacb-3fccb5c8e67d.png)

* Select the project to which you want to add the package.

* Finally, click on **Add Package**.

#### Swift

To leverage package.swift, use the following snippet in your project:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Rudder-Appsflyer",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, and make them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "Rudder-Appsflyer",
            targets: ["Rudder-Appsflyer"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.
        .package(url: "git@github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-appsflyer-ios.git", from: "2.4.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package. A target can define a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package, and on products in packages this package depends on.
        .target(
            name: "Rudder-Appsflyer",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Rudder-Appsflyer", package: "rudder-integration-appsflyer-ios")
            ]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "RudderStackTests",
            dependencies: ["Rudder-Appsflyer"]),
    ]
)
```

3. Initialize the `Appsflyer` SDK before initializing the Rudder SDK as shown below:

```
#import <AppsFlyerLib/AppsFlyerLib.h>

[[AppsFlyerLib shared] setAppsFlyerDevKey:<devKey>];
[[AppsFlyerLib shared] setAppleAppID:<appleAppId>];
[AppsFlyerLib shared].isDebug = YES;
[[AppsFlyerLib shared] start];
```

## Initialize ```RSClient```

Put this code in your ```AppDelegate.m``` file under the method ```didFinishLaunchingWithOptions```
```
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];
[builder withFactory:[RudderAppsflyerFactory instance]];
[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];
```
